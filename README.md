A mill guessing game for my grandpa.

The data was downloaded from the "windmill database" ([molendatabase](www.molendatabase.nl)) using the script in the `data` folder. 
The idea is pretty simple, you are shown a windmill from the Netherlands and have to guess which one it is. On easy mode (makkelijk)
you are presented with four options, on hard mode (moeilijk) you have to enter the name in a textbox. You are then shown if you are right 
or wrong, and then it displays information about the windmill from the database. 

It is possible the images on the database are removed or replaced, in which case they might not load anymore. In this case (or if you don't 
like the windmill you see) you can hit the skip button and are presented a new mill for you to guess!

The project was a pretty simple but fun project to do to try and learn flutter / dart. 

I am in no way affiliated with www.molendatabase.nl.
